# Flatland
Day time viewer for a flattened Earth.

This program (which runs on macOS and iPadOS but not very well on iOS yet) shows an azimuthal equidistant projection (essentailly a flatted globe) of the Earth and rotates it such that noon is always closest to the animated sun. It also (eventually) will show the day and night projected on to the map.
